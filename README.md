# Klausurbot

Helps enter achieved points from exams into a csv file, comparing
given Matriculation number with the csv table of registered students.

Download the csv table from RWTHonline and input it as the first argument.
Second argument is the number of questions.

Enter any registered matriculation number, and confirm with <TAB>.
The student's name will be shown, to compare it with the exam.
Enter points, again using <TAB>. At the end, press <ENTER> to save
the results.

Double clicking on an entry on the right-hand-side table puts you in
the edit mode. Same behaviour when matriculation number is enetered,
that is already present in the results. Again, pressing <ENTER> saves
the results.

The results are saved in results.csv after each <ENTER>.
